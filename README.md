# Speed Typing Test

## Overview
A simple web-based typing speed and accuracy test that measures how fast and accurately users can type a given sentence. The test provides metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), typing accuracy, and the total number of words typed.

## Features
- Generates random sentences for typing practice.
- Measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM).
- Calculates the percentage of correctly typed words.
- Provides a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How It Works
1. A random sentence is displayed for the user to type.
2. The user clicks "Start Test" to begin the typing test.
3. The timer starts, and the user begins typing into the input field.
4. Upon clicking "End Test," the program calculates:
   - **WPM**: Speed of typing in words per minute.
   - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed words compared to the original text.
   - **Total Words Typed**: Number of words typed by the user.
5. The results are displayed below the test.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start the test by clicking "Start Test," type the given sentence, and click "End Test" to view the results.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sentences to the sentence pool.
- Store user progress and history using localStorage or a database.
- Implement difficulty levels with varying sentence lengths and complexity.
- Add support for different languages.
